# How to add NPM to your project?
=> From terminal just type command => npm init - it prompt you for some information give it then it will
generate package.json which is configuration file of the npm.

# What is Parcel/Webpack? why do we need it?
=> They are are known bundler who forms a bundle by compressing all your html files,assets files which is ready to move
into the production. It is used for giving our project superpowers(caching,compression,HMR etc) to make it fast loaded on the browser.

# How to install package on your project?
=> type command => npm install <packagename> or npm i <packagename> 
install package with dependencies => npm install -D <packagename>

# When package-lock.json generated?
=> When you install any package first time package-lock.json file is created it keeps and track the exact verison of the package and its 
sub dependencies and their version, and it is update automatically when you install and update packages. It keeps lock of the exact 
version of the package. Also, there is integrity field in the package-lock.json file which is hash code of the package, which make 
consistent integrity that the package version installed on local server which is also having the same version installed on the production
server as well.

# What is Transitive dependency?
=> When you install any package then that package depend on the other dependency and those dependencies will depend on the other and so on.
So this type of dependency is know as Transitive dependency

# Will it required to add package and package-lock.json to git?
=> Yes, becoz it metntioned all versions of the packages that required on your project when u run npm install command it will look for the 
package-lock.json or not found then package.json file then install all the packages mentioned in the json file so it required to 
add this file on the git repository.

# What is .parcel-cache?
=> It is automatically generated whenever you type npx parcel index.html. It contains cache of the files by adding hash code to it.

# What is npx?
=> It is used to execute or calling the package. for eg: npx parcel index.html (npx <packagename> entrypointfile)

# What is difference between dependencies vs devDependencies
=> When you install any package without adding parameter -D then it added as normal dependencies and with -D as devDependencies in package.json
the difference between dependencies vs devDependencies is that package you requires in production we install as
normal dependencies but the package we requires only in development phase will install it as devDependencies. 

# What is Tree Shaking?
=> Analyzing the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used for eg: comments or console.

# What is Hot Module Replacement?
=> automatically updating the content when you save the file this type of behavior is called the Hot Module Replacement.

# 5 Superpowers of Parcel and describe 3 of them
=> Local server, Diagonostic error, faster builds due to caching create a folder called .partial-cache, automatically refresh the page whenever u update the changes called Hot Module Replacement, 
File Watching Algorithm wriiten in C++, Image Optimization, Minification, SSL support, Tree Shaking

# What is .gitignore? what should we add and not add into it?
=> It is a file when we have mentioned which files should not be included in the git repository. For eg: node_modules, dist , cache folder
becoz its automatically generated when we run the command on the server.

# What is difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
=> package.json keep track of the approx version of the package and package-lock.json keep track of the exact version of the package.

# Why should I not modify 'package-lock.json?
=> It keep track of the exact version of the package and it updated automatically whenever your package version changes.

# What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
=> Whenever you install any package node_modules created with package-lock.json file. It is a directory or database of all the packages and 
its dependencies that you have installed on your project.
It is huge in size and we never push that on git becoz it is automatically created when ever you type command - npm install it will first
look for the package-lock.json file and install all the packages and their dependencies on your project. If the package-lock.json file
is not present then it will look for package.json file.

# What is the dist folder?
=> Whenever you type npx parcel index.html. It generate build folder called dist. This folder is not ready for the 
production becoz it not contains minified version of your files. But when you run npx parcel build index.html it will 
create a folder with same name dist but now its contains the minified version of the code which is ready to go for the production.

# What is browserlist read different dif bundlers vite,webpack, parcel
=> It is a package which add the support of your app to the different browserlist. It means your app support to which version of the browser.

# difference between caret and titde
=> The caret(^) symbol specify a version range that allows both minor and patch updates.
For example, if you specify a package version range of ^1.2.3, your project can use any version of the package that has a major version of 1, 
but with a greater or equal minor version number. This means that your project can use versions 1.2.3, 1.3.0, 1.4.0, and so on, 
but not versions 2.0.0.
The tilde(~) symbol is used to specify a version range that allows patch updates. 
For example, if you specify a package version range of ~1.2.3, your project can use any version of the package that has a major version of 1 
and a minor version of 2, but with a greater or equal patch version number. This means that your project can use versions 1.2.3, 1.2.4, 
1.2.5, and so on, but not versions 1.3.0 or 2.0.0.

# Script types in html
=> Type attribute specifies the type of the script. They are of two type 
1. type="text/javascript" which tell the browser its a normal js file.
2. type="module" which tell the browser is not a normal js file but a module file.

# What is git and github
=> Git is version control system used to track change of the files of your project while github is web based
hosting service which provide you to create git repository which you can push and pull and used for 
future development.
